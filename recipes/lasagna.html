    <h2><u>Description:</u></h2>
    <p>When was lasagna invented? 
    The Italian favorite of lasagne or lasagna that we all know and love originated in the city of <strong>Naples during the Middle Ages.</strong> 
    One of the first references to modern-day lasagne can be found in a 14th-century English cookbook that highlighted a dish with layers of pasta without the tomatoes. 
    Later, another reference was made to lasagne in an Italian cookbook in the 1880s that featured tomato sauce.</p>
